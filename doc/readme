- push cells with the same target color to separate list for
  counting of current color sum. It can go so:
  way 1:
  - first fill step pushes same target color cells in a list
  - first fill step finishes processing
  - plate saved
  - another fill step counting from the middle with that list
  - plate restored
  - result of second fill step is added to the result

  way 2:
  - fill step pushes same target color cells in a list
  - plate saved
  - another fill step runs with that list (on copy of plate)
  - plate restored
  - result of second fill step added to another counter

- check stat for next step color selection
- check several steps further (dynamic prog, minimax)
- push to c_cnt both color counter and coordinates for later use in max
